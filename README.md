# question1
## How it works?
I use Yndex maps static api to get image of place that you input
## For what I did it?
I did it only for solve my homework exercise but you can try to get a post code of a place with that programm, find place with address
you input etc.
## Features that does not work
If you right click on map you will get organization of place you clicked, but if left click on map you will only move map at the direction
of vector from the middle of screen to point of click. It easely can be fixed but I really don`t wont to do it becaue I am lazy
